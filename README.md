This Bootcamp runs about 4 month, 10 sprints

 - Google Sheets [click to see all google sheets projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cyFkvSz7lZpRSHQqoeE-b8-wipPdMJkl20PyGxxHDCE/edit?gid=2026653855#gid=2026653855)
   - Using Google sheets tools such as function, formula, conditional formatting, query, and regular expression for data management, analysis and find insight from data.
     - Project - Array formula employee's that increase salary by 10% next year, create email for each employees, and check email is valid or not.
     - Project - Filter mobile brands and also sort by price.
     - Project - Color highlight on mobile price data using conditional formatting.
     - Project - Querying and summarizing mobile data.
     - Project - Enriching the employee's data using VLOOKUP and Array formula.
     - Project - Converting TH to EN Date.
     - Project - ID Card Parser using regular expression.
 - SQL Database
 - R Programming
   - Project - Create a 'Pao Ying Chub' game [R coding](link)
     - Using R studio to build a game called pao ying chub, start from creating a objects, then using while loop to determine the number of the game, check data input from user, using if clause to set games condition and finally, summarize the game result.
 - Data Transformation
   - Project - Data Transformation by using "dplyr" [R coding](link)
     - Using core functions in dplyr to data manipulation to find insight in dataset "nycflights13" in R studio packages.
 - Data Visualization
   - Project - Create Data Visualization using ggplot2 in R [R markdown](https://github.com/moonpantakarn/dsb-batch11/blob/main/r-programming/Data_viz_ggplot_R.PDF)
     - Creating R Markdown consists of 5 data visualization charts created by ggplot2. load the "dplyr" and "tidyverse" then prepare data by using sample data of diamonds in R packages.
       - Create Distribution of Diamond Carat to understand the needs of customers looking for common sizes versus those seeking rare, large stones.
       - Create Scatter Plot by using Price vs. Carat with Cut as Color to understand product that both carat and cut drive differentiates price  significantly.
       - Create Bar Plot Average Price by Cut and Color. 
       - Create Scatter Plot to find a relationship between Depth, Table, and Price to highlights the sweet spot for maximizing both beauty and value.
       - Create Density that faceting Price Distribution by Clarity to define price points and target customer segments based on their clarity preferences and budget.
 - Statistics
 - Machine Learning
   - Project - Titanic Logistic Regression [R coding](link)
 - Website with WordPress
 - Python
   - Project - Create a 'Pao Ying Chub' game [Python coding](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nBXtcb5oFbBnEx-xPdmQDUQkXrtSVD5x)
     - Using Google Colab to build a game called pao ying chub, start from creating a objects, then using while loop to determine the number of the game, check data input from user, using if clause to set games condition and finally, summarize the game result.
   - Project - Create a 'Pizza Chatbot' game [Python coding](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vdCsP0iXRICH9FBkiW2ZSV6fV9-QncfT#scrollTo=TVMrIjsMtnBX)
     - create a pizza chatbot by creating own function such as look menu, choose menu and then buy by using any payment method
   - Project - Pandas [Python coding](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ecspGA4WFKvt_33SvSXLeL6gGGN2Q3Ps#scrollTo=pcFRkobBRj2q&uniqifier=3)
     - Using core functions in pandas to data transformation to find insights in "sample-store.csv".
   - Project - API [Python coding](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RrGt091eU3-a8w5uZZVkcL1IeUOpqUIf#scrollTo=kbgTYUftP_6X&uniqifier=1)
     - Using get requests for getting response then check status code of api to get data from database, then transform data to find insight.
   - Project - Class ATM [Python coding](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RrGt091eU3-a8w5uZZVkcL1IeUOpqUIf#scrollTo=kbgTYUftP_6X&uniqifier=1)
 - Dashboard
   - Looker Studio [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0216190b-264a-4fe6-a18d-36085a36fe2f)
     - Using Looker Studio to create a dashboards consists of top 5 engagement of posts, customer, weekly vs. monthly detail by using "Freefire vs PUBG" dataset. First, connect the data from Freefire vs. PubG.csv in google sheet. Second, create an impactful report and dashboard and finally, share these reports and dashboards with stakeholders.
